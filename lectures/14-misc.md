This lecture was mainly used for three things:

1) Discussion around "Stop Writing Classes"
2) Introduction to contect managers (by request)
3) Discussions about the exam

Stop Writing Classes
=====================

Object oriented programming can be useful, but it can also be abused. This video illustrates some ways of thinking that might add complexity rather than help writing better programs.

Context managers
================

This was by request, and I haven't produced any particular notes on it. The main question was how the `with` statement in Python works. The general concept is context managers. 

A couple of resources:

- [PEP 343](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/)
