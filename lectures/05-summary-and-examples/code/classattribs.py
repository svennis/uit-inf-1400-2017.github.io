This short example demonstrates how class attributes work. 
Take a look at the code and try to predict the output before 
you read further in the comments. 

The main insight needed to understand the code is that 
python searches for attributes that we try to access.
The search order is as follows: 
1) the object itself
2) the class of the object
3) parent classes of the object
